My last blog post was more than 4 years ago, and a lot has changed in my life since
then. I did work on many technical challenges in these years about which I want to write.
However, I feel my that my personal life had been more challenging. And I wanted to write 
about it even more. Since, I have been a very private and introverted person, I never took
time to create a platform to share my personal experiences. 
This won't be technical at all, I have separate blog posts planned for those. So, if
you don't want to read this, I totally understand.
