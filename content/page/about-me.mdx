Hi there!<br/>
So you want to know about me. Where do I start?<br/>
Hmmm... let's start at very beginning.

## Early life and Family

I was born in a small town called [Bokaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokaro_Steel_City), in Jharkhand India.
If you are familiar with India's geography then you might recall that Bokaro is known for its steel production. 
This city is where I grew up and so its very close to my heart. If you ever visit Bokaro, you will find it to be a 
peaceful city, away from hustle and bustle unlike most other cities in India. Its a planned city, meaning there is no
traffic (if you excuse city center), wide roads, proper drainage, space for kids to play, and so much more. As most 
people here are not native but shifted from various parts of the country to work for 
[SAIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Authority_of_India_Limited), the city has a very 
diverse culture. I can go on and on about Bokaro, but lets talk about my family as well.

[My father](https://www.facebook.com/jugalkishore.prasad) is a Doctor and mother a homemaker. I am blessed to have a 
[younger brother](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anandanimesh/) too. The earliest memory I have of my 
[mundan ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudakarana) where both me and my brother were getting our head 
shaved for the first time and were crying like babies do.

When I grew up a little I developed interest in Science, Mathematics, Computers and Art. I was around 12 years old
when my father bought a computer. It had a very modest configuration even for that time. But that was enough to
get me facinated with the things it can do and we didn't even had an Internet connection. That came later.
I mostly used it play games and run [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) (a program that 
was taught in school at that time). I also used MS Paint a lot. It was around this time I decided become 
a "Computer Engineer" and play video games ðŸ˜›.

## Education

When I was around 2 years old, my parents sent me to Rotary Play School, after that I did my Kindergarten at
[St. Mary's School](https://www.smnsbokaro.in/). From class 1 to 12, I went to [M.G.M Higher Secondary School](https://mgmhssbokaro.in/). 
There was brief period of 3 years (class 2 to 4) when my father went to Patna to do his PHD. At time I went 
to St. Joshep's. But later came back to Bokaro and got admitted into same class in M.G.M. To my surprise, 
few of my classmates remembered me even after 3 years! As if I never left.

At M.G.M I was introduced to HTML, CSS and JavaScript! While my classmates where not that excited about it, I was hooked.
The ability write some code and have it render in an application was facinating for me. I can also link multiple pages
together and have a small world inside an app! I still remembered creating a website for my school and showcasing it
to parents in a school fair ðŸ˜…. My efforts were also appreciated by teachers and parents.

When I went to class 11, I choose Information Technology instead of Computer Science. Mostly because my parents wanted
me focus strictly on Science and Maths (to get into an engineering college) and I wanted some exposure to programming.
Information Technology was considered easier that Computer Science. In it we learned [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)) 
where as in Computer Science, [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) was taught. 
But I learned C on my own anyway. ðŸ˜†

Then came the dreaded engineering entrance exams. I wasn't smart enough to qualify for any of the prestigious [IITs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology), but decent 
enough to get Information Technology in [BIT Mesra](https://www.bitmesra.ac.in/) through AIEEE.

What followed was the best 4 years of my life. The friendships I made here is stronger than any other. I learned a lot
about Computers. Even created some of my early software projects like [Aurora](/projects/aurora/), DC Hub and multiple 
college fest website. By the time I got out of college, I was sure that I wanted to work on the frontend side of 
software engineering.

## Professional Journey

I will keep this section short as I already have a page dedicated to my [work experience](/work-ex/). I started with 
[SAP Labs India](https://www.sap.com/india/about/labs-india.html), one of the best place to start your career. 
Learned a lot of process and got insights into how software is developed in a large MNC. I was surprised to see 
that once in, I have access to all the proprietory code across the company. Something I take for granted these days ðŸ˜…!

I am sure that there were many other surprises at SAP which I don't remember. I then moved to a startup called [OnGrid](https://ongrid.in/).
It was very contrasting to SAP. With a very small shared office and very minimal code. Here I learned how to own a part
of company and drive it. I found some of the closest friends amidst the heated discussions and we regularly connect as
well even after 7 years. Contrast to SAP colleagues who drifted away in the time of time.

[Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com) was the place where I truly learned what frontend means and how to create a website 
for an enterprise with millions of transactions happening every single day. What terror a bad code deployment can have 
and how to manage the dreaded oncalls.

Now I have joined [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) and am excited for the next chapter of my life. Needless to say, wherever I go, I will keep
some values from each of my previous companies.

## Starting a Family of my own

In 2021, I met my beautiful wife [Komal](https://www.facebook.com/komal.shrivastava1), and we tied the knot in 2022. 
Had a kid in 2023! And had many other milestones in-between. [My son](https://www.instagram.com/be.cool_like.me/) is 
sleeping while I write this blog and I cannot express how greatful I am. Sometimes I feel that I am very blessed 
to have a very common life with so many amazing people to spend my time with. Last few years of my life has been running 
on a very fast pace and I cannot express how happy I am that Komal was by my side through all of it with her endless 
talk about completely random things.

## Hobbies

Hobbies is the part that I feel I have ignored a lot in my daily chaotic life. I tried to do sketching and again during
covid and you can see them on [my insta page](https://www.instagram.com/canvascube/). But in last 3 years, I barely had 
any extra time. But now I want to get back on reading and writing. When my son grows up, I plan to paint and play video 
games with him. ðŸ˜Š

If you're into sketching or gaming, let's connect!
