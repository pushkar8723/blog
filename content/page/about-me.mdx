Hi!<br/>
So you want to know about me. Where do I start?<br/>
Hmmm... lets start at very beginning.

## Early life and Family

I was born in a small town called Bokaro, in Jharkhand India. If you are familiar with India's geography then
you might recall that Bokaro is know for its steel production. This city is where I grew up and so its very 
close to my heart. If you ever visit Bokaro, you will find it to be a peacful city, away from hussle and bussle
unlike most other cities in India. Its a planned city, meaning there no traffic (if you excuse city center),
wide roads, proper drainage, space for kids to play, and so much more. As most people here are not native but
shifted from various part of the country to work for SAIL, the city has a very diverse culture. I can go on and
on about Bokaro, but lets talk about my family as well.

My father is a Doctor and mother a homemaker. I am blessed to have a younger brother too.
The earliest memory I have of my mundan ceremony where both me and my brother were getting our head shaved for
the first time and where crying like babies do.

When I grew up a little I developed interest in Science, Mathematics, Computers and Art. I was around 12 years old
when my father bought a computer. It had a very modest configuration even for that time. But that was enought to
get me facinated with the things it can do and we didn't even had an Internet connection. That came later.
I mostly used it play games and run LOGO (a program that was tought in school at that time). I also used MS Paint 
a lot. It was around this time I decided become a "Computer Engineer" and play video games ðŸ˜›.

## Education

When I was around 2 years old, my parents sent me to Rotary Play School, after that I did my Kindergarden at
St. Mary's School. From class 1 to 12, I went to M.G.M Higher Secondary School. There was breif period of 3 years
(class 2 to 4) when my father went to Patna to do his PHD. At time I went to St. Joshep's. But later came back to Bokaro and 
got addmitted into same class in M.G.M. To my surprise, few of my classmates remembered me even after 3 years!
As if I never left.

At M.G.M I was introduced to HTML, CSS and JavaScript! While my classmates where not that excited about it, I was hooked.
The ability write some code and have it render in an application was facinating for me. I can also link multiple pages
together and have a small world inside an app! I still remembered creating a website for my school and showcasing it
to parents in a school fair ðŸ˜…. My efforts were also appriciated by teachers and parents.

When I went to class 11, I choose Information Techonology instead of Computer Science. Mostly because my parents wanted
me focus strictly on Science and Maths (to get into an engineering college) and I wanted some exposure to programming.
Information Techonology was considered easier that Computer Science. In it we learned Visual Basic where as in Computer
Science C was tought. But I learned C on my own anyway. ðŸ˜†

Then came the dreaded engineering entrance exams. I wasn't smart enough to qualify for any of the prestigious IITs, but decent 
enough to get Information Techonology in BIT Mesra through AIEEE.

What followed was the best 4 years of my life. The friendships I made here is stronger than any other. I learned a lot
about Computers. Even created some of my early software projects like Aurora, DC Hub and multiple college fest website.
By the time I got out of college, I was sure that I wanted to work on the frontend side of software engineering.

## Professional Journey

I will keep this section short as I already have a page dedicated to my [work experience]. I started wit SAP Labs India,
one of the best place to start your career. Learned a lot of process and got insights into how software is developed in
a large MNC. I was surprised to see that once in, I have access to all the proprietory code across the company. Something
I take for granted these days ðŸ˜…!

I am sure that there were many other surprises at SAP which I don't remember. I then moved to a startup called OnGrid.
It was very contrasting to SAP. With a very small shared office and very minimal code. Here I learned how to own a part
of company and drive it. I found some of the closest friends admist the heated discussions and we regularly connect as
well even after 7 years. Contrast to SAP colleagues who drifted away in the time of time.

Flipkart was the place where I truly learned what frontend means and how to create a website for an enterprise with
millions of transactions happening every single day. What terror a bad code deployment can have and how to manage
the dreaded oncalls.

Now I have joined LinkedIn and am excited for the next chapter of my life. Needless to say, wherever I go, I will keep
some values from each of my previous companies.

## Starting a Family of my own

In 2021, I met my beautiful wife [Komal](), and we tied the knot in 2022. Had a kid in 2023! And had many other milestones 
in-between. [My son]() is sleeping while I write this blog and I cannot express how greatfull I am. Sometimes I feel 
that I am very blessed to have a very common life with so many amazing people to spend my time with. Last few years of
my life has been running on a very fast pace and I cannot express how happy I am that Komal was by my side through all of it
with here endless talk about completely random things.

## Hobbies

Hobbies is the part that I feel I have ignored a lot in my daily chaotic life.
