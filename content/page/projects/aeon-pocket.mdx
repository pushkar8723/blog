I collaborated with [MehKnown](https://twitter.com/Delta_Maniac) on this project. I think it was his idea.
So, one day I was going on doing my things. You know sleeping, eating, and sometimes coding. And _MehKnown_
pings me and said 'Hey I found a crypto-currency that even you can mine even on your peasant laptop'. So I
checked it out. [AEON](https://www.aeon.cash/) was the crypto-currency he was talking about. A fork of
[Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/) but uses [the CryptoNight-Lite](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/CryptoNight-Lite)
hashing algorithm so that it can be mined on CPU and doesn't necessarily need a powerful GPU.

### The Challenge

I and _MehKnown_ explored AEON for a few weeks and came to know about the web wallet bounty and thought 'we can do that!'.
Later realizing that it isn't just calling a few APIs from the UI kind of project. AEON (like Monero) works with
two cryptographic keys. One for identifying your transactions (known as view key) and another for sending some AEON to 
another wallet (known as spend key). Each of these keys comprises public and private keys. 

The address of the wallet is a combination of public view key and public spend key. To identify if a transaction in a block
in the blockchain belongs to your wallet, you need to use your private view key. And to send some amount of AEON to
another wallet, you need to create a transaction, sign it with your private spend key and post it to the network.
There it will be picked by the miners and if the checks are successful, it will be added to the blockchain.

Simple enough right? That is what I and _MehKnown_ thought. But soon realized that the entire codebase was in C++. Which was
slightly out of _MehKnown_ domain and completely out of my domain. But we tried fiddling with the code anyway. We found that
there is a JS module that was created using [web assembly](https://webassembly.org/) which we can use for these cryptographic
operations.

The major challenge was the part that we were not allowed to transfer the spend key to our server in any case. It can not be
even stored in the browser's local storage. Meaning, to sync a wallet, we need to send each block to the client and then
rely on the client to identify a transaction and tell the server about it. Hence, your wallet cannot be synced in the
background.

### Reception

However, after a month of hard work, we solved the problem and _MehKnown_ announced the [beta release](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/7qceqa/aeon_pocket_secure_web_wallet_for_aeon/)
on AEON's Reddit thread. More than 100 wallets were created on the very first day. And after a month it settled down to
daily 25 active users. People liked what we did. We even got some free media coverage.

### What went wrong?

It was going great for a while but then issues started cropping up. AEON decided to change its internal workings and it
required the user to resync their wallet from the start of the block. A very heavy transaction for us. Anyway, I and _MehKnown_
made it through somehow. Only to realize that there were other such milestones planned. And some of it may require us to
rewrite the entire thing.

Then there was this other very human challenge involved. As AEON is a crypto-currency, money is involved. Many people do
trading on it and make their living from it. Since, we were the only web wallet for AEON, some even relied on it to be up 24x7.
While both me and _MehKnown_ had to do our full-time jobs to pay our bills. Needless to say, whenever any issue happened
someone loses their money and we would be at the receiving end of their rage.

Keeping all these factors in mind we decided to deprecate the project. And with a heavy heart we announced that [we would
go offline on 30th September 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/9dw2vl/aeon_pocket_shutting_down_on_30th_september_2018/).
