### Introduction

To put it simply, Aurora is an online judge system. It is a platform where an admin
can host competitive programming contests and users can participate as an individual
or in a team of three. Its primary motive was to train students for
[the ACM ICPC contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest).
The platform includes features like ranking contestants, penalty, customizable constraints (like
code size, allowed languages, and time limit for execution).

I got to work on Aurora in my final year of engineering. The
[first version of Aurora](https://github.com/kaustubh-karkare/aurora-online-judge)
had a few issues and I felt that a rewrite was required rather than patching the
existing issues. I kept core judge as it was, just introduced sockets instead of the
polling mechanism it had earlier. And rewrote the web interface from scratch.

### Contributions

These changes helped in better scaling and easier maintenance of the system. [Leon Chang](https://github.com/99leonchang)
made a huge contribution that revamped the UI. [Nimesh Ghelani](https://github.com/nims11) and
[Utkarsh Raj](https://github.com/utk1369) introduced an editorial system which admin can
use to easily educate its user about each problem on the platform. I recently did an
architecture overhaul and dockerized the platform to make enhance the security and
maintainability of the system even further.

### Roadmap

Even after these contributions, I feel that now the time has arrived to relook Aurora for a
complete rewrite again. Using the latest tech available for both UI and backend. However,
this would be a great undertaking and I have not laid out any milestone for this revamp yet.
