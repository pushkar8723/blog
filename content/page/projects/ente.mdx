## Introduction

[Ente](https://www.ente.io) is an end-to-end encrypted and fully open-sourced solution. Crafted to ensure the privacy of user's
photos and videos without compromising a lot on features like memories, face search, sharing and many other
that we love and need from a photo storage soultion. It works across platforms, making it easier to share
photos with friends and family privately.

It is the brain child of my friend [Vishnu Mohandas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishnukvmd/) and in 2020 he approached me
to create the web platform for ente. He wanted a simple a web app to show user's their photos inside a browser.
I solved multiple chanllenges in this and even [wrote a blog post](/encrypted-photo-app/). Later this web app packaged
in electron to act as desktop app and support different platforms.

## Reception

Since its inception, ente has been talked about in multile tech forums and was even recommended by Linus Tech Tips for is
ease of use and focus on privacy. The open source community has also shown great interest in ente and it received 
[grant from Mozilla](https://ente.io/blog/mozilla-builders/).

You can watch what Linus had to say about ente in the video below:

## My thoughts

I think [ente story](https://ente.io/blog/why-build-ente/) is quite inspiring for who wants build their own company
or even just make the world a better place. Although I didn't get much time to continue [my contributions on ente](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/commits?author=pushkar8723),
it is on my top priority to start contibuting to ente's web platform.
