Sparkx is my current big project. It started with me building a [React](https://reactjs.org/)
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) boilerplate. But soon evolved into a framework. Then I realized
that it need not be React specific if I can decouple some hard dependencies. Meaning, it has 
the potential to be a framework where a certain part of an application is in react whereas 
some other part can be in [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/), or 
[Preact](https://preactjs.com/).

### Why?

Lately I realized that the JavaScript community is somewhat split as per the view we use. Take
for example this very website. It is made using Gatsby. Meaning I am using React too. Developers
who are familiar with Vue or Angular will need to first learn React and then only they would be
able to reap the benefits of Gatsby.

### How?

Well if you look at any application, it can be mostly split into three parts. Model, View, and Controllers.
Since, I wanted Sparkx to be View agnostic, I only need to come up with a framework that manages the
Model and Controllers. To manage the Model I used Redux and [UI Router](https://ui-router.github.io/)
for routing. Users can create services in native JavaScript. For Controllers they can just extend a 
base controller class and pass this along with their view while creating a route.

### Features

- [x] Support for hash and browser history API routing
- [x] Typed
- [x] Singleton services
- [x] Support for React
- [ ] Support for Preact
- [ ] Support for Vue
- [ ] Support for lit-element

### When will this be completed?

TBH IDK. The more I work on it, the more ideas I get and the goal post slips further away. But I will get
there eventually. And I would also like a helping hand with this. So, ping me if you are interested.
