Like most developers, I spend a lot of my time solving problems for the company I work for.
So, here I list them down.

### LinkedIn

```
Senior Software Engineer - UI | Mar 2025 - present
```

I joined the LinkedIn Bussiness Platfrom team and am excited to see what new problem I will get to work on.

### Flipkart

```
UI Developer III | Apr 2022 - Mar 2025
UI Developer II  | Sept 2019 - Mar 2022
UI Developer     | Mar 2018 - Sept 2019
```

I joined the [Ads Platform](https://brands.flipkart.com) team at [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com) in early 2018
and have since been part of the UI team responsible for managing the frontend of the Ads Platform. During my tenure,
I contributed to multiple projects, one of the most notable being the integration with [Hotstar](https://www.hotstar.com/in)
to enable [video advertisements on the platform](https://inc42.com/buzz/flipkart-hotstar-launch-advertising-platform-shopper-audience-network/).
Additionally, I played a key role in enabling
[multi-language support](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/flipkart-launches-hindi-interface-to-tap-into-next-200-million-e-shoppers/articleshow/70964751.cms?from=mdr) on Flipkart.

After my tenure in Ads, I transitioned to the Flipkart Wholesale team, where I was involved in building
the warehouse platform from the ground up. Additionally, I developed an automation testing framework
on top of [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to test the warehouse platform and mobile applications
across different environments.

Subsequently, I had the opportunity to work on [Shopsy](https://www.shopsy.in), where I led the development
of the web platform. Our team undertook a complete rewrite of the platform using Next.js, consolidating both
mobile and desktop experiences within a single codebase. This initiative aimed to enhance web vitals, reduce
technical debt, improve developer productivity, and minimize boilerplate code.

My day-to-day responsibilities revolve around problem-solving. This includes gathering requirements
from product teams, collaborating with designers to craft intuitive user experiences, finalizing contracts
with backend teams, implementing solutions, conducting testing and deployment, and ensuring the ongoing
maintenance and optimization of these features.

**Tech Stack:** React, React Native, Redux, NextJS, Zustand, Apollo, GraphQL, JavaScript, TypeScript.

### OnGrid

```
Software Developer | Sep 2015 - Mar 2018
```

When I joined [OnGrid](https://www.ongrid.in), the company was just a week old and had only 4 developers. Though the size
of the dev team remained constant while I was working there, the company grew many folds. We even got listed in [YourStory's](https://yourstory.com/)
[top 30 tech startups in India](https://yourstory.com/2016/10/ongrid?utm_pageloadtype=scroll).

Here I implemented multiple solutions from scratch, made sure that iteration on these solutions should be fast and easy, and
at the same time the solution should be intuitive, responsive, and maintainable. I was solely responsible for both customer
and operations website.

**Tech Stack:** Angular, Polymer, JavaScript

### SAP Labs India

```
Associate Developer | Jul 2014 - Sep 2015
```

I got an offer from [SAP Labs India](https://www.sap.com/india/about.html) while I was pursuing my bachelor's degree at [BIT Mesra](https://www.bitmesra.ac.in/).
I joined the [SAP Mobile Secure](https://portal.sapmobilesecure.com/) team. Its an [MDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device_management) platform
and while working here I gained knowledge of various design patterns used in the industry. I was involved in [Android for Work integration](https://blogs.sap.com/2015/05/18/introducing-android-for-work-for-sap-mobile-secure/)
on the platform and creating a [cloud build service for Fiori Apps](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/01/24/create-a-fiori-client-with-the-cloud-build-service-for-on-premise-fiori-launchpad/).

**TechStack:** PHP, JavaScript, SAP Open UI 5
