Like most developers, I spend a lot of my time solving problems for the company I work for.
So, here I list them down.

### Flipkart
<pre>
    UI Developer II | Oct 2019 - Present<br/>
    UI Developer    | Mar 2018 - Oct 2019
</pre>
I joined [the Ads Platform](https://brands.flipkart.com) team of [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com) in early 2018 and
since then been part of the UI team who manages the frontend of the Ads Platform. Here, I was involved in multiple projects 
one of the most notable ones would be the integration with [HotStar](https://www.hotstar.com/in) for running
[video Ads on HotStar](https://inc42.com/buzz/flipkart-hotstar-launch-advertising-platform-shopper-audience-network/).
I also worked on enabling [multiple language support](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/flipkart-launches-hindi-interface-to-tap-into-next-200-million-e-shoppers/articleshow/70964751.cms?from=mdr) on Flipkart.

My day to day work involves solving problems. It starts with getting requirements from the product,
discussing it with design to come up with the most intuitive UX for the problem, finalizing contracts with
the backend teams, implementing the solution, then testing and deploying, and finally maintaining these features.

**Tech Stack:** React, Redux, Apollo, GraphQL, TypeScript.

### OnGrid

    Software Developer | Sep 2015 - Mar 2018

When I joined [OnGrid](https://www.ongrid.in), the company was just a week old and had only 4 developers. Though the size
of the dev team remained constant while I was working there, the company grew many folds. We even got listed in [YourStory's](https://yourstory.com/)
[top 30 tech startups in India](https://yourstory.com/2016/10/ongrid?utm_pageloadtype=scroll).

Here I implemented multiple solutions from scratch, made sure that iteration on these solutions should be fast and easy, and
at the same time the solution should be intuitive, responsive, and maintainable. I was solely responsible for both customer
and operations website. 

**Tech Stack:** Angular, Polymer, JavaScript

### SAP Labs India

    Associate Developer | Jul 2014 - Sep 2015

I joined the [SAP Mobile Secure](https://portal.sapmobilesecure.com/) team. Its an [MDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device_management) platform
and while working here I gained knowledge of various design patterns used in the industry. I was involved in [Android for Work integration](https://blogs.sap.com/2015/05/18/introducing-android-for-work-for-sap-mobile-secure/)
